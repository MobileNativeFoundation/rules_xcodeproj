/// Helps set identifiers for `PBXProj` elements.
///
/// Identifiers are unique 12 byte numbers encoded as 24 character hex strings.
/// Since the various `PBXProj` partial generators need to work independently
/// from each other, they need help to be able to generate unique identifiers.
/// `Identifiers` is used to generate these identifiers.
///
/// The identifiers aren't all hashes. Grouping information is also encoded into
/// them. The first two characters indicate that it's a global element (`FF`), a
/// file or group element (`FE`), or a generator shard (`00`-`FD`).
///
/// - Global elements (which start with `FF`) are then classified as belonging
///   to the project as a whole (`00`) or the `BazelDependencies` target
///   (`01`). For both of them, their associated elements (e.g. configuration
///   list, build phases, etc.) use
///   `00000000000000000000`-`000000000000000000FF`, and their configurations
///   (e.g. "Debug", "Release", etc.) use
///   `00000000000000000100`-`000000000000000001FF`.
///
/// - Files and groups (which start with `FE`) use the remaining characters
///   (`0000000000000000000000`-`FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`).
///
/// - Generator shards (which start with `00`-`FD`) use the next two
///   characters to indicate a target and its associated elements (`00`), a
///   target dependency (`01`), a container item proxy (`02`), or a build file
///   (`FF`).
///
///   - Targets (which start with `xx00`) use the next eight characters to
///     identify a target (`00000000`-`FFFFFFFF`, called a target
///     sub-identifier). Then it uses `000000000000`-`0000000000FF` for its
///     associated elements (e.g. configuration list, build phases, etc.), and
///     `000000000100`-`0000000001FF` for its configurations (e.g. "Debug",
///     "Release", etc.).
///
///   - Target dependencies (which start with `xx01`) and container item
///     proxies (which start with `xx02`) use the next eight characters to
///     identify the dependent target with a target sub-identifier
///     (`00000000`-`FFFFFFFF`). Then it uses the remaining characters to
///     identify the dependency target with the shard and target sub-identifier
///     (`xx0000000000`-`xx00FFFFFFFF`).
///
///   - Build files (which start with `xxFF`) use the remaining
///     characters (`00000000000000000000`-`FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`).
