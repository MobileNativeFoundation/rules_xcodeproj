    /// Bazel uses separate targets for compiling and bundling. So applications
    /// are minimally two targets, one for a static library and one for the
    /// application bundle. Xcode on the other hand uses a single target for
    /// bundles.
    ///
    /// We could choose to represent targets exactly like Bazel does, but this
    /// has a couple of drawbacks:
    ///
    /// - More targets and schemes will be represented in Xcode, which already
    ///   has poor scaling performance based on the number of targets.
    /// - SwiftUI Previews don't work for static libraries, so they wouldn't
    ///   work at all, as no code would be associated with the top level
    ///   targets in Xcode.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - targets: The universe of targets. These will be edited in place.
    ///   - potentialTargetMerges: A dictionary mapping target ids of targets
    ///     that should be merged to the target ids of the target they should
    ///     be merged into.
    ///   - requiredLinks: A set of paths that are linked into top level
    ///     targets. If any of the targets to be merged produce one of these
    ///     paths, then that merge won't happen and will be returned as invalid.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An array of `InvalidMerge` structs for any merges that
    ///   couldn't be performed.
