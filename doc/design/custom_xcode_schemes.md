This document is a proposal for how custom Xcode schemes can be defined and implemented in
`rules_xcodeproj`.

## Automatic Scheme Generation

As of this writing, the ruleset generates an Xcode scheme for every buildable target provided to
the `xcodeproj` rule. This allows a client to quickly define an `xcodeproj` target and generate an
Xcode project.

Let's start with an example.

```python
# Assumptions
#   //Sources/Foo:Foo - swift_library
#   //Sources/FooTests:FooTests = ios_unit_test

xcodeproj(
    name = "generate_xcodeproj",
    project_name = "Command Line",
    tags = ["manual"],
    targets = [
        "//Sources/Foo",
        "//Tests/FooTests",
    ],
)
```

The above declaration generates two schemes: `Foo` and
`FooTests.__internal__.__test_bundle`. The `Foo` scheme contains configuration that builds
`//Sources/Foo`, but has no configuration for test, launch or any of the other actions. The
`FooTests.__internal__.__test_bundle` scheme contains configuration that builds `//Tests/FooTests`
and executes `//Tests/FooTests` when testing is requested.

## Introduction of Scheme Autogeneration Mode for `_xcodeproj`

The `_xcodeproj` rule has a new attribute called `scheme_autogeneration_mode`. The value of
this attribute determines how Xcode scheme autogeneration will occur.

Values
- `auto`: If no custom schemes are provided, an Xcode scheme will be created for every buildable
  target. If custom schemes are provided, no autogenerated schemes will be created.
- `none`: No custom schemes are generated.
- `all`: Generate a scheme for every buildable target.

The default value for `scheme_autogeneration_mode` is `auto`.

## Introduction of Custom Xcode Schemes

A new Starlark module called, `xcode_schemes`, provides functions for defining custom, Xcode
schemes.

### Defining a Simple Xcode Scheme

Building on the previous example, let's define a scheme that combines the two targets,
`//Sources/Foo` and `//Tests/FooTests`.

```python
load(
    "@com_github_buildbuddy_io_rules_xcodeproj//xcodeproj:xcodeproj.bzl",
    "xcode_schemes",
    "xcodeproj",
)

_SCHEMES = [
    xcode_schemes.scheme(
        name = "Foo Module",
        build_action = xcode_schemes.build_action(["//Sources/Foo"]),
        test_action = xcode_schemes.test_action(["//Tests/FooTests"]),
    ),
]

xcodeproj(
    name = "generate_xcodeproj",
    project_name = "Command Line",
    tags = ["manual"],
    schemes = _SCHEMES,
)
```

The `xcode_schemes.scheme` function call defines a scheme with a user visible name of `Foo Module`.
It is configured to build `//Sources/Foo` and `//Tests/FooTests`. (Targets listed in the
test action or launch action are automatically added to the build action.) The scheme is also
configured to execute the `//Tests/FooTests` target when testing is requested.

The result of the function is wrapped in a `list` and passed to the `schemes` parameter of the
`xcodeproj` macro.

### Specifying a Launch Target

Let's continue our example. We will add an `ios_application` and a `ios_ui_test` to the mix.

```python
# Assumptions
#   //Sources/Foo:Foo - swift_library
#   //Sources/FooTests:FooTests = ios_unit_test
#   //Sources/App = ios_application
#   //Sources/AppUITests = ios_ui_test

load(
    "@com_github_buildbuddy_io_rules_xcodeproj//xcodeproj:xcodeproj.bzl",
    "xcode_schemes",
    "xcodeproj",
)

_SCHEMES = [
    xcode_schemes.scheme(
        name = "Foo Module",
        build_action = xcode_schemes.build_action(["//Sources/Foo"]),
        test_action = xcode_schemes.test_action(["//Tests/FooTests"]),
    ),
    xcode_scheme(
        name = "My Application",
        test_action = xcode_schemes.test_action([
            "//Tests/AppUITests",
            "//Tests/FooTests",
        ]),
        launch_action = xcode_schemes.launch_action("//Sources/App"),
    ),
]

xcodeproj(
    name = "generate_xcodeproj",
    project_name = "Command Line",
    tags = ["manual"],
    schemes = _SCHEMES,
)
```

The above example adds a second scheme called `My Application`. It is configured with two test targets
and a single launch target. All three targets are implicitly included in the build list.

### Specifying Launch Arguments and Environment Variables

```python
# Assumptions
#   //Sources/Foo:Foo - swift_library
#   //Sources/FooTests:FooTests = ios_unit_test
#   //Sources/App = ios_application
#   //Sources/AppUITests = ios_ui_test

load(
    "@com_github_buildbuddy_io_rules_xcodeproj//xcodeproj:xcodeproj.bzl",
    "xcode_schemes",
    "xcodeproj",
)

_SCHEMES = [
    xcode_schemes.scheme(
        name = "Foo Module",
        build_action = xcode_schemes.build_action(["//Sources/Foo"]),
        test_action = xcode_schemes.test_action(["//Tests/FooTests"]),
    ),
    xcode_scheme(
        name = "My Application",
        test_action = xcode_schemes.test_action([
            "//Tests/AppUITests",
            "//Tests/FooTests",
        ]),
        launch_action = xcode_schemes.launch_action(
            target = "//Sources/App",
            args = [
                "--my_awesome_flag",
                "path/to/a/file.txt",
            ],
            env = {
                "RELEASE_THE_KRAKEN": "true",
            },
        ),
    ),
]

xcodeproj(
    name = "generate_xcodeproj",
    project_name = "Command Line",
    tags = ["manual"],
    schemes = _SCHEMES,
)
```

This example is the same as the previous one except arguments and environment variables are
defined for the launch action.

## `xcode_schemes` Module

```python

def _scheme(
    name, 
    as_json = True, 
    build_action = None, 
    test_action = None, 
    launch_action = None):
    """Returns a `struct` or JSON `string` representing an Xcode scheme.

    Args:
        name: The user-visible name for the scheme as a `string`.
        as_json: Optional. A `bool` indicating whether the resulting struct 
            should be returned as JSON.
        build_action: Optional. A `struct` as returned by 
            `xcode_schemes.build_action`.
        test_action: Optional. A `struct` as returned by 
            `xcode_schemes.test_action`.
        launch_action: Optional. A `struct` as returned by 
            `xcode_schemes.launch_action`.
  
    Returns:
        If `as_json` is `False`, a `struct` representing an Xcode scheme is 
        returned. Otherwise, a JSON `string` representing the struct is 
        returned.
    """
    pass

def _build_action(targets):
    """Constructs a build action for an Xcode scheme.

    Args:
        targets: A `sequence` of target labels as `string` values.

    Return:
        A `struct` representing a build action.
    """
    pass

def _test_action(targets):
    """Constructs a test action for an Xcode scheme.

    Args:
        targets: A `sequence` of target labels as `string` values.

    Return:
        A `struct` representing a test action.
    """
    pass

def _launch_action(target, args = None, env = None):
    """Constructs a launch action for an Xcode scheme.

    Args:
        target: A target label as a `string` value.
        args: Optional. A `list` of `string` arguments that should be passed to 
            the target when executed.
        env: Optional. A `dict` of `string` values that will be set as 
            environment variables when the target is executed.

    Return:
        A `struct` representing a launch action.
    """
    pass

xcode_schemes = struct(
    scheme = _scheme,
    build_action = _build_action,
    test_action = _test_action,
    launch_action = _launch_action,
)

```

## Changes to `xcodeproj` Macro 

The `xcodeproj` macro will gain two parameters: `targets` and `schemes`.

```python
def xcodeproj(*, 
    name, 
    xcodeproj_rule = _xcodeproj, 
    targets = [], 
    schemes = None, 
    **kwargs):
    """Creates an .xcodeproj file in the workspace when run.

    Args:
        name: The name of the target.
        xcodeproj_rule: The actual `xcodeproj` rule. This is overridden during
            fixture testing. You shouldn't need to set it yourself.
        targets: Optional. A `list` of targets to be included in the Xcode 
            project.
        schemes: Optional. A `list` of JSON `string` values as returned by
            `xcode_schemes.scheme`.
        **kwargs: Additional arguments to pass to `xcodeproj_rule`.
    """
    pass
```

In addition to the what the `xcodeproj` macro does today, if a value is provided for the `schemes`
parameter, the macro will collect all of the targets listed in the test and launch actions and add
them to the build action targets list and the overall targets list. The build actions target list
and the overall targets list will be sorted and duplicated.

> TODO: Do we want to implement a genquery that reduces the target list to leaf nodes (i.e.,
nodes that are not referenced by other targets in the list)?

## Changes to `_xcodeproj` Rule

### `scheme_autogeneration_mode` Attribute

The `scheme_autogeneration_mode` attribute determines how Xcode scheme autogeneration will occur.

__Values__
- `auto`: If no custom schemes are provided, an Xcode scheme will be created for every buildable
  target. If custom schemes are provided, no autogenerated schemes will be created.
- `none`: No custom schemes are generated.
- `all`: Generate a scheme for every buildable target.

The default value for `scheme_autogeneration_mode` is `auto`.

### `schemes` Attribute

The `schemes` attribute accepts a `sequence` of JSON `string` values as returned by
`xcode_schemes.scheme`. The values are parsed and passed along to the scheme generation code in
`rules_xcodeproj`. An Xcode scheme is generated for each entry in the list.
