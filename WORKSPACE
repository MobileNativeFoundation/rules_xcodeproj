# framework. Since this is only used for rules_xcodeproj's tests, we configure
# it here in the WORKSPACE file. This also can't be added to
# `xcodeproj_rules_dependencies()` since we need to load the bzl file, so if we
# wanted to load it inside of a macro, it would need to be in a different file
# to begin with.
